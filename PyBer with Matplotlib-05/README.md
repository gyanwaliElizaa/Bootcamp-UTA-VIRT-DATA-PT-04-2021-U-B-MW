# PyBer with matplotlib
# module 5 Assignment

Analyze and visualize ride-sharing data using Python, Pandas, and the Matplotlib library.


Analysis

Over 60% of all rides and total fare value come from urban riders.
Rural riders tend to take significantly higher cost, albeit fewer, trips than urban or suburban riders.
While comprising about 35% of all rides and fares, suburban and rural cities afford only 22% of Pyber's total driver population. 
There may be a strategic opportunity here to boost driver counts in these regions to enhance market share.
